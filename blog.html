                <p class="secsubTag text-small">They say a picture is worth a thousand words. But I wonder, what
                    else do
                    “they” say? In order to find out I’ve culled together the best quotes on the subject of
                    photography.
                    I hope they inspire you.To me, photography is an art of observation. It’s about finding
                    something
                    interesting in an ordinary place… I’ve found it has little to do with the things you see and
                    everything to do with the way you see them.</p><br>
                <p class="secsubTag text-small">If the photographer is interested in the people in front of his
                    lens,
                    and if he is compassionate, it’s already a lot. The instrument is not the camera but the
                    photographer.</p>

                <p class="secsubTag text-small">Deep cute saying about life can help us appreciate the life that we
                    have
                    right now. It can give meaning and inspiration to our lives. These deep meaningful quotes are
                    suitable for people who are searching for some inspiration in their lives especially when they
                    are
                    feeling down.!</p><br>
                <p class="secsubTag text-small">It is sometimes very hard and scary to understand the meaning of
                    life,
                    but by talking, caring and sharing with the people around you who you love, you can give more
                    meaning to life.One day, you will wake up and there won’t be any more time to do the things
                    you’ve
                    always wanted. DO IT NOW.</p>

                    depth
                    and plain fun of life as the friendships we have.It could be the friendships with our partners,
                    family members, co-workers and the people we have known for a few years now or since we were
                    kids.
                    Or even with people we have never even met at the other side of the world or the pets we love.
